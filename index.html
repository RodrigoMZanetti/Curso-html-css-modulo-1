    <h2>1. Creatine Monohydrate ðŸ¥‹</h2> 

    <p> If you train BJJ and youâ€™re not taking creatine, youâ€™re leaving gains on the table. Period.</p>
    <p>Creatine helps your muscles produce energy during high-intensity training. It boosts your phosphocreatine stores in muscle tissue, which is used to generate ATP â€” the energy <br> currency of your cells.</p>
    <p>BJJ is full of explosive moments â€” bridging, passing, escaping. Creatine increases your short-burst power. Youâ€™ll notice stronger takedowns, quicker scrambles, and less fatigue But itâ€™s not just <br> about strength. Studies show creatine also helps with brain performance, including reaction time and memory â€” both huge in Jiu-Jitsu, where mental fatigue is real.</p>
    <p>Research shows creatine improves strength, muscular endurance, and lean mass. Even better? It's safe. Decades of studies show no serious health risks in healthy individuals.</p>

    <title>Dosage & Timing</title>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with a loading phase:</strong> 20 grams/day for 5â€“7 days.</li>

        <li><strong>Then shift to maintenance:</strong> 3â€“5 grams/day.</li>

        <li><strong>Timing?</strong> Not crucial â€” just be consistent.</li>
    </ul>
